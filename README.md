# Shutdown_VBScript_CBR
## What is it?
VBScript that shuts down a Windows PC past a preset hour, after a few prompts.

## Why?
My driving school has a computer lab and the instructor always tells us to turn off the computers.
People sometimes forget to shut it down and if it's a Friday, they'll stay on until Monday morning.
This script will turn off the PC after 20:00 if it isn't told to postpone in 'n' seconds.

## Motivation
A side project to practice my VBS and git while providing a lightweight solution... if they accept to run my script on their system.
